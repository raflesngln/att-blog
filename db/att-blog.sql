State construction firm, PT Wijaya Karya (WIKA) signed a US$2 billion commitment with Saudi Arabian firm, Adil Makki Contracting Company (AMCO) last week to build 8,000 low cost housing units, as part of government infrastructure improvement. “The realization of the MoU can take place next year,” said Roslan Roeslani, chairman of Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KADIN), after the signing ceremony during the Indonesia-Saudi Arabia Business Forum in the Grand Hyatt.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to an assessment by the National Development Planning Board (Bappenas), the total investment needs for the period amount to Rp 4.8 quadrillion (US$369.2 billion), of which national and regional budgets can only cover Rp 1.98 quadrillion. WIKA and AMCO signing took place during the Indonesia-Saudi Arabia business forum attended by businesspeople and high officials from both countries, including Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) head Thomas “Tom” Lembong, Trade Minister Enggartiasto “Enggar” Lukita and Governor of the General Authority for Small and Medium Enterprises from Saudi Arabia, Ghassan Ahmed Al Sulaiman.</p>',NULL,'2019-01-30 02:01:10',NULL,'investment-bigger.jpg'),(14,'Reducing logistics cost by enabling a pull-based, vertically integrated supply chain through IoT','<p>J\r\nanuary 2019 - The traditional supply chain model often used in retail distribution is outdated and broken. Customers want more and they want it now but businesses’ inability to step up to the mark can leave customers waiting for product or worse - not waiting and going elsewhere. To match modern customer expectations, business needs to adopt modern methods. Changes of this type are far from easy, however, IoT could hold the key to unlocking the supply chain of the future.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to the rise in on-demand services and almost anything you want being just a click away, consumers are becoming more and more demanding. In sympathy with this, commerce and industry are responding by doing everything they can to improve the customer experience and get an edge on the competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The supply chain as we know it\r\nIn a traditional supply chain model, the process typically begins with the manufacture of a product. For this to happen, the manufacturer will need to create a bill of materials for the product and order enough raw materials from their suppliers to make enough of the product to meet consumer demand. For this to happen, the raw materials suppliers need to have enough stock themselves to fulfil the order. If this doesn’t happen, production could be delayed which could lead to a lack of stock at the retailers.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Assuming the manufacturer receives and stores everything they need to make the product, production can begin in line with forecasts. The manufacturer will need to build and ship enough to allow wholesalers to hold enough stock to meet customer demand. The manufacturer will also have to hold extra inventory to ensure that stock doesn’t run out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The product gets built and shipped to the customer. In a perfect world, these processes would happen like clockwork, only the right amount of product would be made and the customer would be happy. However, in reality, it doesn’t work like that”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The use of IoT\r\nIoT can help in both the planning and realisation of a pull-based supply chain. Perhaps the most obvious example of this is in the tracking of inventory. This can help with the initial process mapping to get a handle on lead times and where/when the stock is sitting around. On top of this, sensor networks can monitor inventory levels at each stage, thus allowing the ability to calculate the cost of standing stock. By using simple tracking, the whole of the material flow process can be mapped from raw materials right to the finished product arriving at the customer’s door.\r\n\r\nAs well as helping to set the scene for vertical integration, the visibility gained from asset tracking can immediately be put to good use by helping to identify inefficiencies within the current process that could be quickly fixed, saving costs and time along the way.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Systems integration\r\nUnlike the push process, which begins with a product being made, a pull system is triggered when the customer places an order. In a truly vertically integrated system, the customer’s order would be processed by the retailer’s e-commerce system which would then generate an order from the wholesaler. Likewise, the wholesaler would pass this order onto the manufacturer.\r\nThe manufacturing process begins immediately with orders being sent to the raw materials providers. The raw materials are then shipped in the right quantities to make the product. Subsequently, the product gets built and shipped to the customer.\r\nIn a perfect world, these processes would happen like clockwork, only the right amount of product would be made and the customer would be happy. However, in reality, it doesn’t work like that. For example, it might be too expensive for a raw materials supplier to supply one-off parts. For this reason, some stock may need to be held. By using intelligent decision making at device level, stock levels could be kept to a minimum by ensuring that processing only happens when certain conditions are met. Likewise, the manufacturer may find that some processes need to be batch-based due to high costs of single unit processing. Edge computing could help by ensuring that batches are processed efficiently, only drawing upon resources or issuing parts from stock at the right time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n',NULL,'2019-01-20 02:01:42',NULL,'logistic-cost.jpg'),(15,'ZIM, Maersk Line and MSC to cooperate on the Asia-US East Coast trade\r\n\r\n','<p>ZIM Integrated Shipping Services and the members of the 2M Alliance, Maersk Line and Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), today announced a new strategic cooperation on the Asia – US East Coast trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting early September, 2018, the parties will operate together five loops between Asia and the US East Coast. ZIM will operate one loop and 2M will operate four loops, and the parties will swap slots on all loops.\r\nThe new cooperation offers ZIM’s customers a more comprehensive product portfolio, with a wider range of direct calls in Asia and the US and faster transit time.
